# DockerAPI

## What this repository is for ?
This repository shows a simple example of an **ASP.NET Core API** (build with **C#**) deployed within a **Docker** container.

## How to use it locally ?
Either fork or clone or simply download the repo and use it within a **Visual Studio IDE** - the IDE used for creation of this project was Visual Studio 2022 Community with ASP.NET and .NET support enabled.

You can easily "Docker-run" (and debug) this solution within Visual Studio IDEs, which would then open the only API endpoint URL in your browser and display the simplistic data provided by the PricesController.

## Important notes ..
Please remember that the code examples used within this simple repository (especially __Money__ and __Prices__ classes) are far from ideal for a production-ready project and these classes only illustrate a very basic representation of real-world tangible entities and/or abstractions.
